#  👋  Hey there!

People here call me R!dd13r :upside_down_face: and I'm also known by other names all over the _Big Internet_...

I make **disruptive software** immensely enjoying my _polyglot programming life_ coding using the [happy Kotlin ecosystem](https://kotlinlang.org/ "A modern programming language that makes developers happier."), and also my [_beloved old Scala_](https://www.scala-lang.org/ "“that works” ― Martin Odersky, Programming in Scala"), and still even some <small>Java</small>. _The best and most rewarding part of my calling is helping others excel at being functional._ 

> See my take on [un résumé](https://rdd13r.github.io/rdd13r/)....

I’m an **American** :us: software engineer, US Army :military_helmet: veteran, first generation immigrant (since before the Berlin wall fell), born and raised in the Soviet Ukraine. My spouse and I run a boutique software engineering business and raise our family in the adorable North Carolina. Our market _differentiators are **competence**, performance, diversity and compassion_.
