## The Prediction

**July 2023:** I documented why 80% of enterprise AI initiatives would fail. Not because of AI—because of architecture.

**August 2025:** MIT proved me right at 95%.

While vendors sold magic, I wrote about _**recovery**_.

## What I Do

**I map your exact next steps — from crisis to working AI in production.**

1. Put out the fire by knowing WHY;
2. Recover your journey by knowing HOW;
3. Fix your architecture — AI stays.

_30+ years building systems that survive their first users - and serve their last user well._
