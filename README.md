#  üëã  Hey there!

Friends call me R!dd13r and I go by variants of that for some anonymity.

Many already know me personally because I get around. I made people wealthy through technology I've created over the decades and I haven't lost my soul in the process. And now I also make people happy sharing my passion for coding and engineering. I believe that the key to one's happiness is in doing what one loves the most.

I am an American software engineer and [entrepreneur](https://www.asei.systems/our-team). The last two decades I am working on high-stakes proprietary software and coach "dream teams". Among my customers are traditional conservative American companies, startups, and venture opportunists. And I have tried every type of contract. The decade before, in the 90s, I've contributed to OSS and academic projects along my greatest interests and explored 'the scene'.

My specialty today is <big>_engineering competence_</big> in bespoke business software market. Making useful software **disruptive** using the [Kotlin ecosystem](https://kotlinlang.org/ "A modern programming language that makes developers happier.") makes me happy. As a polyglot programmer I also enjoy my _[beloved old <big>Scala</big>](https://www.scala-lang.org/ "‚Äúthat works‚Äù ‚Äï Martin Odersky, Programming in Scala") - she's been a good functional friend for a long while_, <small>Java</small>, and Python. My other tongues are TypeScript/<small>JavaScript</small>, Haskell, Go, Swift, and Objective-C, just when a situation calls for one, of course. As a _hacker_ coding for more than 30 years ... wait, **_NOT_** the [Hollywood '<small>hacker</small>' kind](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/hackers-and-crackers-a-lesson-in-etymology-and-clear-communication/) - those are [crackers](http://catb.org/jargon/html/crackers.html), the **[<big>_MIT hacker_</big>](https://handbook.mit.edu/hacking)** kind, I am a one person in a large well-defined yet obscure cultural group, just so that we're clear. So, as an ordinary hacker I have an ordinarily long list of passions that come from [my culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) and its [core values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), such as Uncle [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin)'s take on [Clean Code](https://a.co/d/7fnmEdq) that comes from [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) which is gracefully explained to the world by [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck), the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) published by a group of cool hackers, and [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development), [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) ... - the list is long. But these are the things that always start a conversation with me.

_The most rewarding part of my calling is helping others become successful and profitable programmers._ "Give before you get" is one of our core virtues.

> If you need a dream team - take my [un r√©sum√©](https://rdd13r.github.io/rdd13r/) to your boss.

I‚Äôm the Army :military_helmet: veteran and first generation immigrant. My last duty station is Ft. Bragg, NC. I was born and raised in the Soviet, Ukrainian SSR, and I call myself American since before the fall of the Berlin Wall. My spouse and I together run our boutique software engineering business that I'd mentioned above - she's our boss! Our company's market differentiators are **competence**, _performance, diversity and compassion_. Her handle is _ase-boss_.

We raise our family in the adorable North Carolina and live our lives as openly as we run our business. Our 13-years-old son, [Captain Lugaru](https://github.com/CaptainLugaru), loves DnD, storytelling, drawing Manga, and making Minecraft mods with his friends and I. Recently he started interning for his Mom, which is a promotion from helping us run kids' summer robotics camp. On the job he has us perform in his YouTube channel, [Hacker Tales](https://www.youtube.com/@hackertales9227), that he produces as _Stacktrace Studios_. He's deeply fascinated with the [Hacker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture). Captain often comes with me to hackathons, buildathons, and 'click gatherings'. And he knows our _coding friends_ better than I do, often reminding me to connect with people I haven't heard from for a while. That's also how DnD got into our house, by influence of his "adult-hacker" friends, and now our family holds a regular DnD night.

Our lives are quite hectic and packed with activities. So, I am struggling to publish some OSS DDD archetypes here, which I've been hoping to release for a while now. I only manage to complete the proprietary ones for ASE Inc., that people license from us. Nonetheless, last year we went all out of our way to help people hurt by the war in Ukraine. And, in December we welcomed our newborn daughter. She doesn't yet have a hacker handle as she's 3-months-old and does not code ... yet üòú. My boss-wife believes in karma and tells me that our newborn is God's reward for being good to people. This "reward" adds tasks to the family Kanban board in the kitchen but her smiles always make everything alright, especially for Captain Lugaru! He loves spending time with her. Little Captain kept asking for a sister for a long time. And when we brought her home from the hospital he looked at me and said - "Daddy, you are sooooo slow!" So, there you go! My reply was - "Aren't good things worth waiting for?"

K... I best go help Cpt. with his homework.
