#  👋  Hey there!

People call me R!dd13r :upside_down_face: _I am grateful to have coached some of the smartest software engineering teams on the planet!; Happily, over the course of my 30+ years long coding career._ <br>

I’m an **American** :us: software engineer, US Army :military_helmet: veteran, first generation immigrant (since before the Berlin wall fell), born and raised in the Soviet Ukraine. My spouse and I run a boutique software engineering business and raise our family in the adorable North Carolina. Our market _differentiators are **competence**, performance, diversity and compassion_.
