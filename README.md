#  üåü Greetings, Adventurer!

My friends know me as [R!dd13r](https://rdd13r.github.io/ "R!dd13r - <rdd13r>"), let me clear the fiddle,  
A digital artisan, unraveled, yet opposite to brittle.  
Crafting disruptive software, nurturing minds, in code I wade,  
Among a race of my silent visionary makers,  
  for the life and not for the takers,  
  in shadows our LOLs we parade.

<summary>A Shadow-whispered Tale...</summary>

In a world where few dare to peek [_at these scrolls_](https://github.com/trending "Trending: See what the GitHub community is most excited about today."),  
My tale weaves through whispered praises and cracker trolls.  
A digital nomad, seeking wisdom among peers,  
Gathering bright minds, exploring a new frontier.  

My heart is steadfast, enriching lives through code art,  
A passion for magic, in programming, I impart.  

An **_American_** software engineer,  
An [entrepreneur](https://www.asei.systems/our-team "Advanced Software Enterprises, Inc. - Let us nurture your Dream Team!") so keen,  
Taking people to lands of no-fear,  
Guiding dream teams unseen.  

On an epic journey together to _elegant sources_,  
A path of competence we humbly embrace,  
Crafting spells with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/ "A modern programming language that makes developers happier") at [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/kotlin "Kotlin Heroes"),  
Making magic with _[Scala's](https://www.scala-lang.org/ "‚Äúthat works‚Äù ‚Äï Martin Odersky, Programming in Scala") functional grace_.  

**[<big>_Teams of hackers_</big>](https://handbook.mit.edu/hacking "Hacking is about learning.")** for decades I train,  
Embracing culture so vast, enigmatic, untamed.  
Uncle [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin "Robert C. Martin")'s [Clean Code](https://a.co/d/7fnmEdq "Amazon link to the Clean Code book") inspires us to strive,  
[Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck "Kent documented hacker activities, culture, norms, tools, and methods")'s [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming "Extreme Programming was a good capture of our culture") keeps our passion alive.  

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/ "The declaration of Agile Manifesto") we hold dear,  
In spirited conversations we find cheer.  
[Maker culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture "Maker culture side of Hacker Culture") our passions it fuels,  
Replacing Cogs with well coded tools.

The most enchanting part of this quest,  
Empowering others to be their best.  
Thriving, prosperous programmers we mold,  
"**_Give before you get_**," our creed, so bold.

Are you still with me?

<summary>A Family of Dreamers...</summary>

An Army :military_helmet: veteran and first-generation immigrant, I hail from Soviet Ukraine and embraced my cherished American identity before the Berlin Wall fell. True Americans, my spouse and I co-pilot our boutique software engineering venture, where she reigns as _ase-boss_. We champion **competence**, _performance, diversity, and compassion_ - the values of American hackers.

Our family's story unfolds in charming North Carolina, where our lives intertwine with our open-hearted business, customers, friends, and community. Our 13-year-old son, [Captain Lugaru](https://github.com/CaptainLugaru), revels in DnD, Manga, and Minecraft mods. His newfound role interning for his mother leads to the creation of his YouTube channel, [Hacker Tales](https://www.youtube.com/@hackertales9227). Captain's fascination with [Hacker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) brings us all together at hackathons and click gatherings, where DnD nights have become a beloved family tradition.

Amidst our bustling lives, I strive to help people learn, publish OSS DDD archetypes, support those affected by the war in Ukraine, and contribute to our American community. Our family recently welcomed a newborn daughter, whose angelic presence, though adding tasks to our family Kanban board in the kitchen, fills our hearts with joy. Her arrival reminds us that good things come to good people.

I beam with pride as Captain Lugaru blossoms into a wise and compassionate soul. As we navigate this enchanting journey together‚Äîfamily, friends, and business‚ÄîCaptain is learning the ways of life. One day, watching a mature company struggle with technology, he ponders these words:

> Only enemies speak the truth.
>
> Friends and lovers lie endlessly,
>
> caught in the web of duty.

-- Stephen King

Curious, he asks, "Daddy, if our conservative customers always hide their true state of affairs, won't they see us as enemies because we're always open and truthful, like in the quote?" I respond, "Son, as long as we're true to our values, we'll be fine. We can still help such customers even if they see us as outsiders." And with that, I share an old Georgian toast and wise tale:

A young sparrow, unprepared for migration, ignores the change of time and reason. This poor obsoleting soul faces a harsh winter. Near death, he is warmed by a passing cow dropping a pie over him. Regaining strength, he sings joyfully. But a farm cat hears him, pulls him from the dung, and eats him. The moral:

1. Not everyone who poops on you is your enemy.
2. Not everyone who gets you out of poop is your friend.
3. When life grants you a precious second chance: embrace silence, gather your thoughts, listen, learn, assess, devise a strategy, and always remain objective, doing the right thing. Together, we can help the laggard sparrows on their journey to safety should they accept our help.

Now, I must go and aid wise Captain with his homework.
