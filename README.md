#  üåü Greetings, Adventurer!

My friends know me as [R!dd13r](https://rdd13r.github.io/ "R!dd13r - <rdd13r>"). Allow me to unveil the enigma: I am a digital artisan, crafting disruptive enterprise software, nurturing minds, and breathing life into code...

<details>
<summary>A Whispered Tale...</summary>

In a world where few dare to read these scrolls, my tale weaves through whispered praises, as clients sing of my feats. A traveler of lands, sharing wisdom and orchestrating grand gatherings, my heart remains steadfast, enriching lives through the mystical art of coding.

An **_American_** software engineer and [entrepreneur](https://www.asei.systems/our-team "Advanced Software Enterprises, Inc. - Let us nurture your Dream Team!"), I ventured into high-stakes realms, guiding dream teams to greatness. My path, a journey through _shared source_, cherishes the enchanting [Kotlin ecosystem](https://kotlinlang.org/ "A modern programming language that makes developers happier") and the loyal, functional companion, _[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/ "‚Äúthat works‚Äù ‚Äï Martin Odersky, Programming in Scala")_.

With 30 years as an **[<big>_MIT hacker_</big>](https://handbook.mit.edu/hacking "Hacking is about learning.")**, I hold dear the vast, enigmatic, and influential culture that fuels my passions. Entranced by Uncle [Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin "Robert C. Martin")'s [Clean Code](https://a.co/d/7fnmEdq "Amazon link to the Clean Code book"), [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck "Kent documented hacker activities, culture, norms, tools, and methods")'s [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming "Extreme Programming was a good capture of our culture"), and the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/ "The declaration of Agile Manifesto"), I find delight in spirited conversations.

_The most enchanting part of my journey is empowering others to become thriving, prosperous programmers._ "Give before you get" is the essence of our creed.

Are you still with me?

<summary>A Family of Dreamers...</summary>

An Army :military_helmet: veteran and first-generation immigrant, I hail from Soviet Ukraine and embraced my cherished American identity before the Berlin Wall fell. True Americans, my spouse and I co-pilot our boutique software engineering venture, where she reigns as _ase-boss_. We champion **competence**, _performance, diversity, and compassion_ - the values of American hackers.

Our family's story unfolds in charming North Carolina, where our lives intertwine with our open-hearted business, customers, friends, and community. Our 13-year-old son, [Captain Lugaru](https://github.com/CaptainLugaru), revels in DnD, Manga, and Minecraft mods. His newfound role interning for his mother leads to the creation of his YouTube channel, [Hacker Tales](https://www.youtube.com/@hackertales9227). Captain's fascination with [Hacker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture) brings us all together at hackathons and click gatherings, where DnD nights have become a beloved family tradition.

Amidst our bustling lives, I strive to help people learn, publish OSS DDD archetypes, support those affected by the war in Ukraine, and contribute to our American community. Our family recently welcomed a newborn daughter, whose angelic presence, though adding tasks to our family Kanban board in the kitchen, fills our hearts with joy. Her arrival reminds us that good things come to good people.

I beam with pride as Captain Lugaru blossoms into a wise and compassionate soul. As we navigate this enchanting journey together‚Äîfamily, friends, and business‚ÄîCaptain is learning the ways of life. One day, watching a mature company struggle with technology, he ponders these words:

> Only enemies speak the truth.
>
> Friends and lovers lie endlessly,
>
> caught in the web of duty.

-- Stephen King

Curious, he asks, "Daddy, if our conservative customers always hide their true state of affairs, won't they see us as enemies because we're always open and truthful, like in the quote?" I respond, "Son, as long as we're true to our values, we'll be fine. We can still help such customers even if they see us as outsiders." And with that, I share an old Georgian toast and wise tale:

A young sparrow, unprepared for migration, ignores the change of time and reason. This poor obsoleting soul faces a harsh winter. Near death, he is warmed by a passing cow dropping a pie over him. Regaining strength, he sings joyfully. But a farm cat hears him, pulls him from the dung, and eats him. The moral:

1. Not everyone who poops on you is your enemy.
2. Not everyone who gets you out of poop is your friend.
3. When life grants you a precious second chance: embrace silence, gather your thoughts, listen, learn, assess, devise a strategy, and always remain objective, doing the right thing. Together, we can help the laggard sparrows on their journey to safety should they accept our help.

Now, I must go and aid wise Captain with his homework.
