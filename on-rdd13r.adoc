Once upon a time, in the magical land of UNIX daemons and cryptic code, a young immigrant coder found himself in a strange new world. His boss, kind but perplexed, tried to understand the riddle-like comments within the code he wrote. Aided by his trusty friend John, our hero tried to explain his creations, but the language barrier proved to be a challenge.

One fateful day, John, inspired by the riddles, christened the coder 'Riddler,' and so the legend was born. Though our hero was initially dismayed by the name, which he associated with a notorious super-villain, he soon learned to embrace the handle. After all, they did share a love for puzzles, challenges, and the color green.

Time passed, and our protagonist thought the Riddler persona would fade into the mists of memory. He joined the Army, seeking new adventures and believing that his hacker friends would forget the handle. But fate had other plans. Riddler's name lived on, whispered in the halls of companies and echoed in the tales of his exploits.

Years later, our hero found himself in the prestigious halls of Deutsche Bank, surrounded by a new clique of hackers. He believed the name Riddler had been left far behind, but the winds of fate can be unpredictable. One day, during a heated conversation, his boss uttered the nickname, rekindling the legend of the Riddler once more.

Our hero realized that the name was not a burden, but a symbol of camaraderie and a testament to his journey. From that day forward, he wore the name R!dd13r with pride, and the enchanted tale of the Riddler lived on, forever woven into the tapestry of hacker lore.
